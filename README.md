Single player version of Pong with a cyberpunk aesthetic. Created for the RE:Start! 2022 PSP Game Jam


Gameplay:
- Meant to be played like pong. Player should use the paddles to keep the ball in play long enough to reach the exist node.
- Game has five "levels". Each run gets longer leaving more time for the ball to reach maximum velocity.
- Player has three extra balls to try and finish each run.

Controls:
- Original controls are to hold L or R and use UP and DOWN to move the respective paddle.
- Alternate controls are to use UP and DOWN along with CROSS and TRIANGLE to move the different sides.


Glitch Hint:
- There is a reason the original controls aren't mapped to the CROSS and TRIANGLE buttons
